Prior to these makes ure you have installed mysql libraries necessary to make python work and it is running 
espescially in using      


                mysql.connector.connect 

                    OR 
                    
                  mysql.connector 






 ?  NB : i made these changes to the socket in  my.cnf file in /opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf

 					          starts from below
                        		:
                      	   \ /


# NB : The following options will be passed to all MySQL clients
[client]
#password	= your_password
port		=3306
#socket		=/opt/lampp/var/mysql/mysql.sock
socket		=/var/lib/mysqld/mysqld.sock

                      		  :
                      	   \ /
                         the END




 ?  NB : i also made these changes to the socket in  my.cnf file in /etc/mysql/my.cnf

                      starts from below
                      		  :
                      	   \ /

# * IMPORTANT: Additional settings that can override those from this file!
#   The files must end with '.cnf', otherwise they'll be ignored.

!includedir /etc/mysql/conf.d/
!includedir /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/


[mysqld]
socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

[client]
socket=/path/to/socket
 
                       		  :
                      	   \ /
                         the END





 ?  NB : i also made this changes in the flask app to listen to the port of the xampp that is after starting the xampp way ahead so it choses port 3306 first 

                      starts from below
                      	   	:
                      	   \ /

#  ADDING  these configurations helped with  

#    connecting xampp mysql server   WITH  flask-mysqldb 

#  app.config['MYSQL_UNIX_SOCKET']='/opt/lampp/var/mysql/mysql.sock'    
#  app.config['MYSQL_PORT']=3306


                         		:
                      	   \ /
                         the END


                     ?     Last but not least 

not for forgetting  i created a new user for my sql and gave it priviledges and passing a mynativepassword to it also created same user name with ssame password in xampp user account and granted it all access to all databases with grant Elisha taught me which i saw on the internet. 

By granting permission after creating user and going to general mysql without standing in any database and writing the code  below ;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'localhost';



GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost';

NB : over here we realise  database_name is * so it  makes the user have access accross all databases.
